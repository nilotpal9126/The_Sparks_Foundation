This repo will contain projects/tasks completed during TSF-GRIP- internship.
####Given the dataset conataing hours fo study and the scores achieved prediction model has to be built. 
#####Predict how would the score be if the student studies for 9.25 hrs/day.
######Data modelling done and predicted using ensemble techniques(boosting.)

This projects clearly depicts how bias can affect the data prediction.
Encountered a high bias using the linear regressor which resulted in a very hihg value tahn expected.
This project clearly shows how ensemble techniques (bagging and boosting) can provide a better prediction.
